This system is used for the early detection of stunting in toddlers with age calculation from date time now and birthdate from LCD input, height and weight calculation by the ultrasonic sensor and load cell sensor, stunting calculation using Standard Data from World Health Organization (WHO) which connected with printer thermal to print toddler's nutritional status data. Also, this system is integrated with WhatsApp API and Web App with line chart features for each toddler.

This system uses some of the components below: 

1. TFT ILI9488 3.5" Touchscreen
2. Ultrasonic Sensor HY-SRF05
3. Voltage Sensor
4. ESP32 Devkit V1
5. Load Cell Sensor
6. HX711 Module
7. Battery Sony VTC6
8. Printer Thermal


nb: I can't share the "TBU.h", "BBU.h", "BBTB.h", and "IMTU.h" files because those files contain important data from WHO
